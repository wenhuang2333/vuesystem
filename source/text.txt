The Season of Falling Snow

In the years I spent in my hometown, there is one person I could never forget.

She was my neighbor’s child, named Luoxue. We had known each other since childhood, growing up side by side—from the noisy games of primary school to the first steps of middle school. In those days without computers or mobile phones, one’s bond with the world was far deeper. Every joy, sorrow, anger, and laughter I experienced arose only from what I saw, what I did. That is why the memories I shared with her, the more distant and blurred they become, the sweeter and more beautiful they seem to me.

When we entered middle school, though we were no longer in the same class, our homes were along the same path. So we would always wait at each other’s classroom door after school, and walk back together.

One evening in our first year, when the summer twilight overflowed the sky, we were, as usual, heading home. Suddenly, she said she wanted to take a walk along the river.

I asked her why. She said she had discovered a secret place unknown to anyone else, and wanted to show it to me.

And so she pulled me along, running through the narrow paths between fields, toward the riverbank. Along the way were crimson licorice plants and green banana leaves.

“Now, we have to go upstream!” she cried.

She ran ahead, full of excitement. I followed behind, watching her silhouette dance among the golden ripples of sunset on the river, and I felt nothing but joy.

After about ten minutes, we seemed to reach the end of the path—a dense bamboo grove blocked the way.

A cool breeze stirred, making the bamboo whisper like a song traveling to some distant place.

“Come on, follow me. Don’t fall behind,” she said.

I nodded, and together we slipped sideways through the bamboo fence.

Panting, we pushed our way through, and then the view suddenly opened up. Ahead of us, a tree stood quietly at the end of the path, its branches heavy with white blossoms swaying gently in the wind, surrounded by wild grasses dancing in the breeze.

Luoxue ran into the grove, gently caressing the blossoms, the fresh sprouting buds. She smiled, bathing in the tranquility of that place.

The murmur of the river nearby, the birds singing among the bamboo, the sigh of the fading wind, and her soft humming—together they wove an eternal tapestry of life.

“I love this place. Truly… I love it so much,” she said.

Whenever studies were not too heavy, on Friday afternoons or on leisurely weekends, she would always come here alone.

Sometimes she would drag me along. She must have learned some craft at school, for she would pick flowers and herbs here, weave vines into circles, and then tuck the blossoms into the gaps to make wreaths. Smiling, she would ask me:

“How does it look? Pretty?”

Of course, I always said it was.

“Hmm…” She pondered for a while, then suddenly placed the wreath on my head.

Our eyes met in that moment.

“Ah, it doesn’t suit you at all. You’re just lying to me!” she giggled.

I laughed, apologized, and took the wreath down, studying it carefully.

But to me, it really was beautiful. “I think it’s lovely,” I said softly.

Then I looked up at her. “Everything here is beautiful—just like you. Gentle, and sweet.”

The sky glowed with twilight. Across the river, two birds perched on a telephone pole seemed to be saluting the dawn on the far side of the world. Pebbles beneath the vines whispered farewell to pumpkin leaves carried away by the water.

All of them were cloaked in the same dusk that now brushed across Luoxue’s cheeks.

She shrank back a little, her face blooming with shy redness.

Her eyes fixed on the gravel at her feet, and she whispered: “As long as you know… This is our secret. You can’t tell anyone else.”

That hidden world became a secret only she and I shared, a garden of memories known to no one else.

The lighthearted days of our first year soon passed. In the second year, we still spent much time together, chatting about the week’s little joys or frustrations.

But gradually, our talks turned toward worries about schoolwork, confusion about the future. I would explain concepts to her, trying to ease her troubles.

“I’m so tired,” she often sighed.

“It’s okay,” I said. “As long as you understand, keep your own pace—you’ll be fine.”

“But… I can only do the textbook questions. The practice exams from those top city schools, the final problems in the mock tests—I don’t even understand them!”

“It’s alright, Luoxue.” I looked at her anxious face, trying to calm her. “I’ll always be here.”

She only smiled faintly and said no more. I thought to myself: the next time we return to our secret place, maybe she’ll find her own path, maybe she’ll grow confident. Maybe we can keep walking side by side.

But by the third year, our visits grew rarer. Before the high school entrance exam, it had been half a year since we last went there together.

One afternoon, a month before the exam, I heard she hadn’t come to class. At dusk, something stirred in my memory. I rushed out of school, retracing old paths, until I found her standing before that white-blossomed tree, lost in thought.

She turned slowly, as if startled, and walked toward me.

“I didn’t expect you to come.”

Her voice trembled, like a pear blossom shivering in the wind.

I didn’t know what to say. I stood in silence, meeting her gaze.

Finally I said, “Let’s go home.”

The last echoes of daylight faded at the edge of the stars. Along the country road, only sparse streetlamps stretched our two shadows across the ground.

Neither of us spoke. When I brought her to her doorstep and turned to leave, she called after me:

“You know… I actually—”

I stopped and looked back. She hesitated, her face dimming, and finally smiled faintly. “It’s nothing. I forgot what I wanted to say.”

When the exam results came, I was admitted to a city high school. But Luoxue had to stay behind.

We parted ways.

The morning of the graduation ceremony, I met her on the road. She asked if I would stay until the end.

“No, Luoxue. I’m leaving tomorrow.”

“…I see.”

Later, after the ceremony, while I was packing, a classmate from her class left me a message. When I wasn’t there, she had slipped a note into my notebook.

Someone told me about it, but I was in a hurry to leave. I stuffed all my books into my bag without looking, and walked out of the school.

Most of those books I later threw away. I kept only one notebook, as a memento.

The next day I left, and I did not return for many years. In the city I studied, graduated, worked, lived.

That notebook was forgotten, hidden on some dusty shelf. Until the other day, when I found it while cleaning.

I brushed off the dust and opened it at random. What had once been hard knowledge now seemed like child’s play. And then, suddenly, a bookmark slipped out.

I picked it up. On it were written the words:

“In the evening, will you come to our ‘secret’ place again?”

The paper had yellowed, and the ink had absorbed the scent of time. Yet the tenderness in those words still tugged at my heart, blurring my eyes, pulling me back into thought.

Winter was near. Late autumn, perhaps. Snow was falling in my hometown.

I returned to the place where I had once lived. Nothing seemed to have changed, except her house now belonged to another family.

I learned that a few years ago, Luoxue had married far away, her family moving with her.

In silence, I retraced our path—past withered herbs, dried banana leaves. The bamboo grove had long since fallen into ruin. The wind howled, the sky hung heavy, the river froze into silence.

Further on, the graceful tree had vanished too, leaving only a lonely stump.

I stood there wordless. In its broken rings of time, I seemed to see the secret of the girl I had missed.

Did she once stand beneath that tree, plucking blossoms, her eyes full of hope and longing as she watched the path for me—only to be disappointed, leaving in tears under the sparse stars?

I do not know. And she will never know.

Now, it is I—alone, and only I—left to stand, as the snow falls, endlessly, endlessly.
